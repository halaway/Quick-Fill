Soon available on the Chrome Web Extension Store.
Although, to install, simply fork the reposistory and ```cd/Quick-Fill``` directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/halaway/Quick-Fill.git

# To Use
While running a live server for the ```index.html``` file, navigate to the Chrome browser's extensions tab and ```Load Unpack``` the **Quick Fill** project.
When accessing any Workday Account registration web page, simply select the autofill option.

Finally, all user information is strictly stored on Chrome's Local Storage asynchronously. Overall, this extension should generally only be used to speed up the job application and account creation process with Workday.
